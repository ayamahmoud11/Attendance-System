# Face Recognition Based Student Attendance and Monitoring System
Efficient attendance management is crucial for educational institutions, where traditional methods often prove inefficient, inaccurate, and prone to fraud. This project introduces a robust, face recognition-based attendance system designed to automate and enhance the process of student tracking and monitoring.

# Motivation
Traditional attendance-taking methods are time-consuming and occasionally unreliable. This project addresses these challenges by leveraging advanced facial recognition technology to streamline attendance processes, reduce administrative burdens, and provide real-time monitoring of student participation. By automating attendance, educators can focus more on teaching while ensuring accurate record-keeping and immediate alerts for irregularities such as students attending the wrong classes.

# Features
## Modules Overview
### Student Enrollment
Capture and store basic student information along with facial images for database enrollment.

### Face Detection and Recognition
Detect and recognize students' faces in real-time using computer vision algorithms for accurate attendance marking.

### Face Tracking
Monitor and track student presence during class sessions to provide instant feedback on attendance status.

### Enrollment Validation and Alerting
Validate student attendance against their assigned classes and trigger alerts for discrepancies.

### Attendance Report
Generate comprehensive attendance reports that can be exported in formats like Excel and PDF, facilitated through a Power BI dashboard.

### Graphical User Interface (GUI)
Design a user-friendly web application to manage student details, receive alerts, and export attendance reports for each class section.

### Integration
Seamlessly integrate modules to enable real-time video processing, accurate face detection, recognition, and efficient reporting within the GUI interface.
Ensure compatibility with existing infrastructure to enhance adoption and usability across educational settings.
